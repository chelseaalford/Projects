# Projects
Here are the projects I completed, either individually or as a team, during my masters program at The Fuqua School of Business.

1. **Decision Tree Analysis:** Built a decision tree modeling uncertainties in a litigation case using sensitivity analysis, VOI analysis, and utility analysis.
2. **Health Care Analytics:**
       Performed data exploration, visualization, and linear regression to derive important insights from health care data.
3. **Inventory Management Simulation:** Managed the inventory for a simulated lab using an (r, Q) inventory model. Monitored backlog, purchasing, ordering, and holding costs, lead times, processing time, capacity, utilization, and supply and demand across the lab to maximize profit within the simulated environment.
4. **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
       Employed a Monte Carlo simulation to identify an optimal order quantity given uncertainties in production. Explored various optimal solutions using            utility theory analysis, VOI analysis, and probabilistic dependence.  
5. **NBA Case Study:**
       Employed people analytic tools to identify top NBA talent and quantify the benefits of talent acquisition. Used a multivariate linear regression built using the Lasso method to assess playersâ€™ contracts.
6. **Optimization Model:**
       Built an optimization model to maximize profit given production constraints. Employed sensitivity analysis on plant efficiency, supply constraints, and cost to explore various optimal solutions.
7. **People Analytics:**
       Analyzed team dynamics using network analysis, sentiment analysis, and silo analysis.
8. **Predictive Modeling for COVID-19 Containment Measures:**
       Utilized random forest modeling, bootstrapping, linear regression, and data visualization to examine effect of containment measures on the current              spread of COVID-19. Highlighted effective and ineffective measures in curbing the spread of the virus.
9. **Reducing Departure Delays at RDU Dashboard:**
       Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau visualizing departure delays at RDU airport. Identified the root causes of delays and recommended the              implementation of a 3-sigma control limit monitoring system as a solution.
10. **Regression Analysis on Infant Mortality in India:**
       Analyzed infant mortality rates in India with multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares. Explored the effect of instrumental variables on omitted variable bias and simultaneous equations on simultaneity bias.
11. **Regression Analysis on Red Wine:**
       Utilized linear regression, bootstrapping, random forest modeling, and classification trees to build a model that predicts the quality of any given red        wine.
12. **Spotify Predictive Model:**
       Developed four linear regression models which identify the variables most highly correlated with a song's popularity in various musical genres. 
13. **Trader Joe's Corporate Strategy:**
       Developed a comprehensive industry analysis of the grocery industry as well as a detailed consulting report in which we provide recommendations to              company executives based on our thorough analysis. Leveraged strategic tools including VRIN analysis, environmental analysis, Porter's five forces a            analysis, SWOT analysis, competitor analysis, and activity systems analysis.

I also completed several projects in SQL and Tableau that I am unable to share due to privacy restrictions. 
Below are brief descriptions of these projects, though there is no documentation of them in my Projects folder. 

14.	**Dognition Data Querying:** Queried data in SQL for Dognition pet company. Performed data cleaning and gathered impactful data insights on customer retention. 
15.	**Baseball Data Querying:** Queried MLB data deriving insights on salary efficiencies, win percentages, player health, postseason performance, and homerun records. Utilized subqueries, CTEs, joins, and window functions to perform analysis in SQL.
