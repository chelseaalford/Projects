# Projects
Here are the projects I completed, either individually or as a team, during my masters program at The Fuqua School of Business.

I also completed several projects in SQL and Tableau that I am unable to share due to privacy restrictions.

1. **Decision Tree Analysis:** Built a decision tree modeling uncertainties in a litigation case using sensitivity analysis, VOI analysis, and utility analysis.
2. **Health Care Analytics:**
       Performed data exploration, visualization, and linear regression to derive important insights from health care data.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation:**
       Employed a Monte Carlo simulation to identify an optimal order quantity given uncertainties in production. Explored various optimal solutions using            utility theory analysis, VOI analysis, and probabilistic dependence.  
4. **NBA Case Study:**
       Employed people analytic tools to identify top NBA talent and quantify the benefits of talent acquisition. Used a multivariate linear regression built using the Lasso method to assess playersâ€™ contracts.
5. **Optimization Model:**
       Built an optimization model to maximize profit given production constraints. Employed sensitivity analysis on plant efficiency, supply constraints, and cost to explore various optimal solutions.
6. **People Analytics:**
       Analyzed team dynamics using network analysis, sentiment analysis, and silo analysis.
7. **Predictive Modeling for COVID-19 Containment Measures:**
       Utilized random forest modeling, bootstrapping, linear regression, and data visualization to examine effect of containment measures on the current              spread of COVID-19. Highlighted effective and ineffective measures in curbing the spread of the virus.
8. **Reducing Departure Delays at RDU Dashboard:**
       Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau visualizing departure delays at RDU airport. Identified the root causes of delays and recommended the              implementation of a 3-sigma control limit monitoring system as a solution.
9. **Regression Analysis on Infant Mortality in India:**
       Analyzed infant mortality rates in India with multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares, instrumental variables, and simultaneous            equations.
10. **Regression Analysis on Red Wine:**
       Utilized linear regression, bootstrapping, random forest modeling, and classification trees to build a model that predicts the quality of any given red        wine.
11. **Spotify Predictive Model:**
       Developed four linear regression models which identify the variables most highly correlated with a song's popularity in various muscial genres. 
12. **Trader Joe's Corporate Strategy:**
       Developed a comprehensive industry analysis of the grocery industry as well as a detailed consulting report in which we provide recommendations to              company executives based on our thorough analysis. Leveraged strategic tools including VRIN analysis, enivornmental analysis, Porter's five forces a            analysis, SWOT analysis, competitor analysis, and activity systems analysis.
